WIKIMATIC SYSTEM

This is a m4 macro templater system that generates wikis as static sites. 
It is relatively simple to use, but, there's a few things that I need to 
work out before it's ready for primetime. There's no gradients or other such 
effects, so, it should (in theory) display on any browser ever. Since very old 
browsers don't properly display background colors, this may or may not look 
good on Netscape 3.0. For examples, just look at any of the .doc files. This
is essentially a custom document processing language that gets interpreted by
m4 and cranks out HTML files (with a singular dependency -- the stylesheet).
Images can be stored in-place or on an external CDN (as with any static site).
