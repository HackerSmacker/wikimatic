Design guidelinks for WikiMatic

1. No crazy voodoo code macros! No insane recursive macros or looping macros!
2. The end user has to be able to make good-looking pages.
3. No active content at all... who needs it?
4. Be easy to use. There's no sense to not be able to make this easy; after all, easy and good can exist together!
